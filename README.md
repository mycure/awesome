This project extends Nolan Lawson's
[pretty S3 index.html](https://github.com/nolanlawson/pretty-s3-index-html).

Just place the index.html file at the root of an AWS S3 bucket. Make sure
the bucket and files are publicly accessible. Go to the appropriate URL
https://[your-unique-bucket-name].s3.amazonaws.com/index.html and it will
display an hiearchical view of your S3 files.
